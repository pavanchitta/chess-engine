This repo implements a simple chess AI


Design Doc

Tasks

- Build a representation for the board and pieces and board state. Also 
figure out how to represent and execute moves
- Construct a value function in order to evaluate the state of a board, ideally
a combination of heuristic-based and learning-based
- Develop algorithm to train the AI to play, probably a simple minimax approach
- Create a simple interactive web-app UI to be able to interact with user. Should
be able to do this with the pgn board images.
